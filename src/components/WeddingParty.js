                Siraya is the brides sister and Katie wanted nothing more than
                to have her by her side when she marries Jimmy. Siraya worked on
                the cruise ship with Jimmy and Katie â€“ so she has been there

                Liz (a kindred heart from Wisconsin) met Katie and Jimmy while

                us to share the day was an easy choice.

                before Katie and Jimmy moved to Florida. She quickly became a
                close friend (and cherished cousin ðŸ˜‰) and there was no question
                to have her a part of the day.
