      <h1>WHAT ABOUT COVID?</h1>
      <p>
        Emerald Ridge Farm is a 33 acre property that we have for the entire
        weekend. There is plenty of space to spread out and the buildings are
        set for a indoor/outdoor flow to keep the air fresh and free. The staff
        are all fully vaccinated and take the proper measures to deep clean the
        property before and after each event. We would love for you to join in
        celebrating, but understand if there are reservations.
