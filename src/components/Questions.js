          <u>WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VENUE AND COVID-19?</u>
        </strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Emerald Ridge Farm is a 33 acre property that we have for the entire
        weekend. There is plenty of space to spread out and the buildings are
        set for a indoor/outdoor flow to keep the air fresh and free. The staff
        are all fully vaccinated and take the proper measures to deep clean the
        property before and after each event. We would love for you to join in
        celebrating, but understand if there are reservations.

        <strong>
          <u>WHAT IS THE ATTIRE?</u>
        </strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Semi-formal - as it is November in the mountains, please bring something
        or dress to keep warm as the temperatures may be cooler than expected.
        As you know, Jimmy gets cold easily and he's made sure that there will
        be outdoor gas heaters to keep everyone warm and comfortable during the
        reception. Unfortunately, we will not have heaters set up during the
        ceremony so blankets are encouraged!
